## Tech Stack Plan
### Problem Solving Story
- Users will be greeted with a brief introduction to the invention of Multicore Processors.
    - In the past, computer processors were mainly single core. This meant computer programs ran linearly, and never spontaneously. However, sometime in 2005, CPU chip companies started experimenting with multicore CPUs, increasing chip productivity exponentially. This led to the release of the dual-core processor, a rather obsolete architecture compared to the quad or octa-core processors we commonly use today.

### Interactive Element
- a. Users are given a set of computational tasks and must process them by adjusting CPU parameters, i.e., currently active cores, clock speed, voltage, and cooling.

    - **Active Cores** - Users are free to adjust the number of cores being utilized by the processor. While more cores give increased efficiency, they also increase power consumption and heat output.
    - **Cooling** - Users will be limited by the amount of “cooling” they choose (65 watts, 100 watts, etc.). Once the cooling chosen gets overwhelmed by the user’s chosen input config, the CPU may perform thermal throttling, slowing down its own computational speed.
    - **Clock Speed (GHz)** - Users may adjust the number of cycles the processor can execute per second. Like the aforementioned active cores, increasing the clock speed improves efficiency at the cost of heat and power.
    - **Cooling Solution (TDP) **- Users may select the maximum amount of heat the cooling system must generate from 65W, 100W, or 150W. If the selected cooling system is less than the heat generated, the CPU's performance will be impacted.

- b. Users are also able to view the estimated Actual Power, Execution Time, Status, Effective Clock, and Total Energy Score of the CPU.
    - **Actual Power** - The calculated actual power consumed by the processor.
    - **Execution Time** - The estimated amount of time it would take to clear the given workload. (For now, this is a constant of 5000)
    - **Status** - The state of the individual core given the parameters. (Optimal, Inactive Core, Throttling)
    - **Effective Clock** - Display for the selected clock speed in GHz
    - **Total Energy Score** - Computed total energy score in J

- c. The goal is to finish the tasks using the least amount of resources, meaning the most efficient in time and power used. Ideally, the user learns:
    - Excessively increasing the power consumption and clock speeds of a CPU risks producing too much heat and getting thermal throttled.
    - To achieve a high score, they must learn to choose the multicore architecture to distribute the tasks among the different cores, then choose the most efficient input combination to finish the task.

- d. The following are the formulas to be used in computation (using programming syntax):
```
workload = 5000 (fixed task units constant)
basePower = cores × clock² × 1.5 + cores × 5
throttling = basePower > TDP
effectiveClock = throttling ? clock × √(TDP / basePower) : clock
actualPower = throttling ? TDP : basePower
efficiency = throttling ? TDP / basePower : 1.0
execTime = workload / (cores × effectiveClock × efficiency)
energyScore = actualPower × execTime
```

- e. The screen will display the 8 cores of the CPU. Inactive cores are neutral, while active cores are colored. Green for Active cores, neutral for Inactive cores, red for Throttling.
